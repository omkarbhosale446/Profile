	<h3>Independent Projects</h3>
        <ul class="papers">
            <li><h4>Reduction and Strategic Management of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions in an Engineering Office</h4>
		Conducted an independent project focused on <b>quantifying and reducing CO₂e emissions</b> across multiple operational dimensions of a multinational engineering office. The study involved identification of emission sources, calculation of GHG factors, and development of <b>short-term (2-year) and long-term (5-year) reduction strategies</b> under multiple operational scenarios. The project emphasized <b>process optimization, behavioral interventions, and sustainability-driven decision-making,</b> contributing to actionable insights for organizational carbon reduction.</li>
	      
        </ul> 

        <h3>SLB OneSubsea</h3>	
        <ul class="papers">
            <li><h4>Vxuxs Project (TOTAL Energies)</h4>
		<b>Role:</b> Lead Product Engineer<br>
		Managed engineering responsibility for <b>16 foundations, 28 Umbilical Termination Assemblies (UTAs), 4 Flowline Distribution Frames (FLDFs), and 2 Subsea Distribution Units (SDUs).</b> The project is planned for installation in an offshore field in <b>Namibia,</b> with manufacturing, assembly, and testing activities distributed across <b>Malaysia, Norway, and Namibia.</b> Components were sourced globally from <b>Norway, the UK, Malaysia, China, India, the USA, and Brazil.</b> This role required coordination across geographically dispersed stakeholders, supplier interfaces, and cross-cultural engineering teams, ensuring technical compliance, schedule adherence, and supply-chain integration.</li>
 
	    <li><h4>Roncador Project (Petrobras)</h4>
		<b>Role:</b> Lead Product Engineer<br>
		Oversaw engineering delivery for <b>4 subsea foundations</b> for an offshore field in <b>Brazil.</b> Manufacturing, assembly, and testing were conducted in <b>Brazil,</b> with components procured from <b>the UK, Brazil, and the USA.</b>
The project emphasized localization of manufacturing and supplier coordination while maintaining global engineering standards.</li>
	    <li><h4>Product Standardization Initiative (Internal Project)</h4>
		<b>Role:</b> Lead Product Engineer<br>
		Led the development of a <b>standardized subsea foundation design,</b> with approximately <b>80% of components optimized for reuse across multiple offshore fields worldwide.</b>
The standardized product was designed to be manufacturable at <b>both internal and external facilities,</b> resulting in significant <b>reductions in cost, lead time, and engineering effort,</b> while improving scalability and repeatability across projects.</li>
	    <li><h4>LAPA Southwest Project (TOTAL Energies)</h4>
		<b>Role:</b> Product Engineer<br>
		Managed engineering scope for <b>4 foundations, 6 UTAs, and 2 SDUs</b> for an offshore field in <b>Brazil.</b> Manufacturing, assembly, and testing were planned across <b>Brazil and the USA,</b> with components sourced from <b>Norway, the UK, China, India, the USA, and Brazil.</b>
The project involved complex logistics planning and coordination between multiple international vendors and fabrication yards.</li>
        </ul>      

<h3>The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI)</h3>
        <ul class="papers">
            <li><h4>Research on Buzz, Squeak and Rattle (BSR)</h4>
		Conducted applied research aimed at developing <b>reliable and sustainable solutions to reduce Buzz, Squeak and Rattle (BSR) in passenger vehicles.</b> The work focused on identifying root causes, evaluating mitigation strategies, and proposing engineering solutions that balance <b>performance, durability, and sustainability.</b></li>
	    <li><h4>Testing</h4>
		Assisted in <b>lifecycle testing and validation</b> of components across multiple industries, including <b>automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and electronics.</b> Gained hands-on experience in testing methodologies, failure analysis, and performance validation under varying operational conditions.</li>
