            Hello!! I am a <b>Senior Product Engineer at <a href="https://www.onesubsea.slb.com/">SLB OneSubsea</a>,</b> working in a project engineering capacity within the <b>Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Installation (EPCI)</b> framework for large-scale subsea developments. My role involves the coordination and technical leadership of multidisciplinary engineering teams, the management of interfaces across a diverse set of internal and external stakeholders, and the integration of <b>technical, schedule, and commercial considerations</b> across the full project lifecycle. I actively contribute to the delivery of complex deepwater oil and gas projects in global offshore environments, with particular emphasis on engineering governance, structured decision-making, and the effective orchestration of engineering activities under conditions of high technical and organizational complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
            I completed my <b>Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering</b> from <a href="https://www.unipune.ac.in/">Pune University</a> in 2020, followed by a <b>Master’s degree in Design Engineering</b> from <a href="https://mitwpu.edu.in/">MIT World Peace University</a> in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I was a founding member of the university’s Formula Student team and subsequently led the team over four years, guiding participation in multiple national and international competitions. This experience strengthened my capabilities in technical leadership, systems integration, cost–schedule optimization, and team coordination under competitive constraints. 
        </p>
	
	<p>
		During my Master’s program, I conducted <b>applied research at the <a href="https://www.araiindia.com/">Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI)</a>,</b> focusing on the development and optimization of methodologies for reducing automotive noise. In addition to research activities, I participated in component and system-level testing, gaining practical exposure to experimental validation, performance assessment, and industry-standard testing protocols.
	</p>

	<p>
		In parallel with my professional responsibilities, I actively contribute to <b>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives at SLB OneSubsea.</b> As part of this effort, I was involved in the development of a <b>dedicated <a href="https://mitwpu.edu.in/subsea-lab">research laboratory</a> for undergraduate and postgraduate students,</b> enabling hands-on research in subsea engineering technologies. This facility represents the <b>only research laboratory of its kind in Asia,</b> and serves as a platform for academic–industry collaboration, student training, and early-stage research exposure in offshore engineering.
